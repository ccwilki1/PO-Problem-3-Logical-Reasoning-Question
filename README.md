# Problem # 2
## Multiply by 11


### Given a positive number as a string, multiply the number by 11 and also return it as a string. However, there is a catch:

### You are NOT ALLOWED to simply cast the numeric string into an integer!

### Now, how is this challenge even possible? Despite this, there is still a way to solve it, and it involves thinking about how someone might multiply by 11 in their head. See the tips below for guidance.

String Multiply1 = "11";
String Multiply2 = "121";
String Multiply3 = "1331";
String Multiply4 = "14641";
String Multiply5 = "161051";

Console.WriteLine(Multiply1);
Console.WriteLine(Multiply2);
Console.WriteLine(Multiply3);
Console.WriteLine(Multiply3);
Console.WriteLine(Multiply4);




# Problem Number 3 
## PO-Problem-3-Logical-Reasoning-Question



### In this logic question, you are standing in a room with three light switches. The switches all correspond to three different light bulbs in an adjacent room that you cannot see into. With all the light switches starting in the off position, how can you find out which switch connects to which light bulb?

### 1. All light switches will be given a number from 1 to 3 starting from left to right. and all light bulbs will be assigned a number in each room from 1 to 3
### 2. Turn on the first and second light switch, and then walk into room no. 1 with Light bulb number 1.  If this light bulb is off, then assign the 3rd switich that is off to this light bulb. However, If light is on, record which switches are on, and the turn one of the two switches off. Record results. 
### 3. the two remaining switches, turn  one of the switches  on, and the other off. Walk into the room and record if the lightbulb is on or off. They should match the switches accordingly.
